# Source code

You can get the source code of our products here:

- [Desktop](https://github.com/acridotheres/acridotheres)
- [CLI](https://github.com/acridotheres/cli)
- [Mobile](https://github.com/acridotheres/mobile)
- [PWA](https://github.com/acridotheres/web)

All products listed above are built around the [Acridotheres Core Library](https://github.com/acridotheres/core).

Also, this website and the developer documentation are open source:

- [This website](https://github.com/acridotheres/website)
- [Acridotheres for Developers](https://github.com/acridotheres/developers)

Please take into account that the Acridotheres+ services are not open source, but we have documentation on how you can use their interfaces in your projects.
The documentation is detailed enough to help you build your own services that are compatible with Acridotheres, but these have to be trusted manually as they are not managed by us.
