# Acridotheres+ Backups

Acridotheres+ Backups is a service that just stores your files. These can be optionally encrypted using WebAuth or custom encryption keys, and you can also share them with others using Archive Sharing.

These backups are also used internally to dynamically download archive files as needed, so you don't have to download a very large archive file just to access a single file in it.

Also, Acridotheres+ Backups are supported in our custom archive format HSSP natively since specification version 4 (released 2023) and through additional data in most of the other formats we support.
